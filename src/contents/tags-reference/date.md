### gmt

By setting this parameter to '1', you can get the GMT equivalent of the date provided.

### locale

If you use the locale-aware format characters mentioned above, this parameter can be set to the locale desired for formatting the provided date.

```
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='french' />
```

```
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='italian' />
```

<p class="error">This feature depends entirely on the indicated locale being available at your web server. If the locale is not available, the default 'english' locale is used.</p>

### charset

Some locales do not provide their output in UTF8 character set. This causes strange ?? characters to appear in the output.<br/>
The **date** tag can help converting the output to UTF8 if you can provide it with information about the charset used by the locale.

For example -

```
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='greek' charset='ISO-8859-7' />
```

```
<cms:date k_page_date format='%B %d, %Y' locale='russian' charset='ISO-8859-5' />
```

The following is a rough list of the charset used by different languages -

**ISO-8859-1 - Latin 1**<br/>
Western Europe and Americas: Afrikaans, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Faeroese, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.

**ISO-8859-2 - Latin 2**<br/>
Latin-written Slavic and Central European languages: Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Croatian, Slovak, Slovene.

**ISO-8859-3 - Latin 3**<br/>
Esperanto, Galician, Maltese, and Turkish.

**ISO-8859-4 - Latin 4**<br/>
Scandinavia/Baltic (mostly covered by 8859-1 also): Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. It is an incomplete predecessor of Latin 6\.

**ISO-8859-5 - Cyrillic**<br/>
Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian.

**ISO-8859-6 - Arabic**<br/>
Non-accented Arabic.

**ISO-8859-7 - Modern Greek**<br/>
Greek.

**ISO-8859-8 - Hebrew**<br/>
Non-accented Hebrew.

**ISO-8859-9 - Latin 5**<br/>
Same as 8859-1 except for Turkish instead of Icelandic

**ISO-8859-10 - Latin 6**<br/>
Latin6, for Lappish/Nordic/Eskimo languages: Adds the last Inuit (Greenlandic) and Sami (Lappish) letters that were missing in Latin 4 to cover the entire Nordic area.
