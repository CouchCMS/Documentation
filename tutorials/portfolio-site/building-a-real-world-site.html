            <article><h1 id="building-a-real-world-site">Building a real-world site</h1>
<p>To demonstrate the power and ease of Couch, we&#39;ll build a complete real world site from scratch using it.</p>
<p>The template we have chosen to do so is Aurelius.<a href="http://www.couchcms.com/docs/code/Aurelius.zip"><img alt="" src="../../assets/img/contents/download.png" style="border: 0; float: right;"/></a><br/>
It was originally created to be sold commercially at Themeforest. However the author later on changed his mind and very graciously released it as a free template.</p>
<p>We chose this template because it has almost all the sections that you&#39;ll come across while building a similar site -</p>
<ul>
<li>About Us</li>
<li>Portfolio</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Contact Us</li>
<li>Home</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be found at <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/free-website-template/"><em>http&#58;//net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/free-website-template/</em></a>. You can choose to download it from the aforesaid link or get it from <a href="http://www.couchcms.com/docs/code/Aurelius.zip">here</a> (our version has all unnecessary files removed).</p>
<h3 id="installing-aurelius">Installing Aurelius</h3>
<p>Couch works by retrofitting within an existing working site. As such, our first step will be to get the static Aurelius site working.<br/>
Unzip and upload all the files of Aurelius to your web server.</p>
<p class="notice">
    You can use any hosted space that you might have for the purpose of this tutorial. However that would entail FTP&#39;ing the modified files back to the server every time you make any changes.<br/>
    <br/>
    A more pragmatic approach would be to use <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> or <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">WampServer</a> on your local machine. This way you can directly make changes to local files.<br/>
    <br/>
    For this tutorial, we&#39;ll assume that your web server is hosted locally and hence will simply say &#39;edit this file and save it&#39; instead of &#39;edit this file locally and FTP it back to your server&#39;.
</p>

<p>If you are using the files downloaded from <em>http&#58;//net.tutsplus.com/</em>, remove the <em>Documentation</em> and <em>psd</em> folders as well as the <em>config.php</em>, <em>send_email.php</em> and <em>full_width.html</em> files as these will no longer be needed by us (this won&#39;t be necessary if you downloaded the template from our site).</p>
<p>The resulting folder structure should look like this -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Confirm that all the pages of this template are now accessible through the browser.<br/>
With the website in place, we can now move on to install Couch within it.</p>
<h3 id="installing-couch">Installing Couch</h3>
<p>Download and unzip <em>couch.zip</em>. You&#39;ll get a folder named <em>couch</em> containing the following files -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Rename the file named <em>config.example.php</em> to <em>config.php</em>.<br/>
Open it in your text editor and find the following lines -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Change the values to match those of your MySQL database.</p>
<p>Upload the entire <em>couch</em> folder, along with the modified <em>config.php</em>, to your web server, which already contains the Aurelius files.<br/>
The resulting site structure should now look like this with the <em>couch</em> folder appearing as a subfolder of your existing site -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p class="notice">
    The uploaded <em>couch</em> folder is your site&#39;s admin section.<br/>
    It is a good security measure to rename this folder to anything else you wish. This way you&#39;ll make it more difficult for unwanted visitors to try and access your admin section.<br/>
    For this tutorial we&#39;ll assume you have chosen to go with the default name.
</p>

<p>Access the admin section through your browser - <em>http&#58;//www.mytestsite.com/couch/</em></p>
<p class="success">For the rest of this tutorial we&#39;ll assume the site&#39;s address to be <em>http&#58;//www.mytestsite.com/</em>. Replace it with your site&#39;s address for all examples.</p>

<p>Couch will sense that installation is required and will display the following form for you to fill -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="notice">If, however, at this point you get an &#39;500 Internal Server Error&#39;, please try deleting the .htaccess file present in the &#39;couch&#39; installation folder. Certain hosts, notably GoDaddy, have problems with the directive contained in this file.</p>

<p>Enter your desired name, password and email address. Press install and in a little while you should be prompted with the following screen -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Couch created an account with super-admin privilege using the information provided by you in the last step and is now prompting you to login using the same.</p>
<p class="error">
    <strong>V. Imp:</strong> This account created for you by Couch is a very special one. This is the account you need to be logged in with, whenever you wish to make any &#39;structural&#39; changes to the website as a designer - (which, for the site we are building now, is the entire duration of this tutorial).<br/>
    <br/>
    Only one such account can ever exist in one installation of Couch. Be sure to provide a valid email address during installation so that it could be used in password recovery if you happen to forget this account&#39;s password.
</p>

<p>Login using the super-admin account you created and brace yourself for facing the most &#39;barren&#39; admin section you&#39;ll ever come across -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This almost bare admin panel is an important feature of Couch.<br/>
We realize that the person most often logged into it is going to be the client that you&#39;ll be building the website for and, more often than not, he is not going to be as computer savvy as you are.<br/>
Instead of overwhelming such a client with an admin panel that resembles the cockpit of an airliner, we wished to confront him with just as much information as is absolutely essential.<br/>
As we move along with building the site, the admin panel will start displaying more information. This is the admin panel of our finished site -</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/contents/portfolio-site-8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is important to note that the admin panels of no two sites built with Couch are going to be identical. As the designer of a website, it is you who&#39;ll choose how much data gets exposed to the client within the admin section.</p>
<p>With Couch installed we can now begin porting the Aurelius files to it.</p>
